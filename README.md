# ISO8583-JSON-XML
This library is used to convert messages from one format to another. The supported formats are ISO 8583, JSON, and XML.

Beginner programmers often experience difficulties when parsing and building data with ISO 8583 format. Most programmers are more familiar with human readable formats such as JSON and XML. On the other hand, however, the company requires the ISO 8583 format because some or all of the partners use that format.

Using this library, both senior programmers and novice programmers will be easier to build applications that use the ISO 8583 message format.
